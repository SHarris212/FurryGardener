/*
* Concept: Player is a witch or wizard doing odd jobs, attending classes in your chosen college of study, learning new spells, and progressing through life
* Each year will be a prestige, spent earning 'college points' as a form of currency by attending different classes and learning spells to spend those points 
* 	on upgrades
*	- After school, college points will become some sort of political/professonial points
* 
* There will be a secondary currency of magical money, spendable on other kinds of upgrades, or better upgradees or something
*
* Each prestige will increase points and money earned from each activity
* Your birthday will be the prestige point, it is triggered by earning a certain amount of points and money and is all spent on your party
* As an adult you will save some money for after your party, which will be upgradeable and slowly go up as you get older
*
*
*	How XP works: You earn 1 x multiplier per tick for the active skill, the more advanced the skill, the more required
*	An XP multiplier comes from prestige, a small one from experience in the skill, and a small one comes from averaged 
*		skill levels gained, this encourages working on each skill.
